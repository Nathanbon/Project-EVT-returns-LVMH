The objective of this work is to identify the distribution of the tails of the distribution of daily returns of LVMH shares. We use two methods: the block maxima and the POT method to estimate the tails of the distribution and calculate different metrics to quantify the maximum losses (vaR, ES, etc.). There is :
 - a .R file which contains the R code with comments and an import with Yahoo Finance.
 - a .pdf report to understand the steps of the code
